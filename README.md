***FO - T***
======

Also known as "folder-template," **fot** is a simple tool that lets you start a project *without the hassle of creating the same folders over and over again.* **Create once... and never again.**


**Installation**
------------

Open your command line/terminal and type the following:
>**npm install fot -g**


**Setup**
-----

To let **FO - T** know where to look for, when cloning templates.

**To setup your installation of *FO - T* do the following:**

1. Create a folder containing all of the templates you would like to use and navigate into that folder using your cmd/terminal.
2. Type the following in your cmd/terminal:  **`fot here`**
>Alternatively:  You could use 
>**```fot set {{arg}}```**
>Here - '**arg**' is the absolute path to ***inside*** your templates folder.

3. That's it, You're all set! Mom's gonna be really proud...

>**Note**: You can change your templates directory by doing the steps above with another path or you can clear the path(more about that in the next section.)

**Clear Path**
--------------
Accidentally set the wrong path? Just type the following to clear the templates path:

>**fot clear**

**Usage**
-----

To clone a template simply:

1. Navigate into your project folders ***parent directory***.
2. Type 
>**```fot clone {{template name(inside your templates folder)}} {{OPTIONAL new foldername}}```**

Billy is a developer. And with every project, Billy needs to create a lot of folders, files and most of the time needs to write the same boiler plate code **over and over again** UGH... Billy doesn't like this.

Trying to combat this problem, Billy stumbles upon ***FO - T***: the easiest tool to use for folder-templates.

Now Billy can just move all of his boiler plate folders and files(with the code) to one directory and clone the templates from there whenever he wants to start a new project! ***Billy loves this!***

**Billy does the following:**
1. He creates a 'templates' folder in his documents because he finds that convenient.

![better][pic1]


2. In his command prompt, he goes inside the templates folder and does the following to set his templates directory.


![appreciate][pic4]


![this][pic5]


3. He then creates a template which he knows he will be using a lot in the future.


![elaborate][pic3]

4.  Now he can clone any folder/file from inside the 'templates' folder to anywhere he wants, with **ease.**


5. He goes inside his 'projects' folder which is in his documents folder and types just ***ONE*** command to clone all of his files into the projects folder. Oh and he also renames it.
